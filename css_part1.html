    ? what is CSS?

    * CSS stands for 'Cascading Style Sheet', is a language used to describe the look and presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. it defines how elements are displayed on a web page...

    ! Creators and Maintenance of CSS :
    -----------------------------------

    * CSS was created by the group of individuals known as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)...

    * Primary contributers includes "Hakon wium lie" and "Bert bos" ...

    * CSS standards and specifications are maintained by W3C ...

    ? CSS1 (1996)
    * Limited properties and selectors..
    
    ? CSS2 (1998)
    * CSS2 was released and work on CSS3 began..
    
    ? CSS2.1 (2011)
    * CSS2.1 was released, which fixed the errors found in CSS2..

    ! CSS rule structure :
    ------------------------

    * A CSS rule consists of a selectors and declaration block.

    * Declarations are used to define the style properties for the selected elements.

    * Each declaraction consists of a property and a value.

    ?         selector {
    ?             property : value;     <----- declaration
    ?             ...upcoming more declarations...
    ?         }

    ! how to use CSS in html?
    -------------------------

    * there are 3 ways:

    ? 1) Inline CSS:
    * Style applied directly to an HTML element...

    ? 2) Internal CSS:
    * Styles defined within the <style> tag within the HTML document's <head>...

    ? 3) External CSS:
    * Styles stored in seperated '.css' files linked to the HTML document using the <link> element...

    ! selectors:
    ------------

    * there are mainly 3 types of CSS selectors:

    ? 1) using html element selector:
    * ex: p{}, h1-h6{}, div{}, span{}, etc...

    ? 2) using id selector:
    * ex: #para{}, #heading, #container{}, etc...

    ? 3) using class selector:
    * ex: .para{}, .heading{}, .container{}, etc...

    ? there is one more type is very famous! is 'pseudo-class-selectors':
    * ex: a:active{}, a:link{}, a:visited{}, a:hover{}, etc...

    ! CSS Comments:
    ---------------

    * comments are very useful to specify some imp information which will not affect the actual code and is useful to developer, also it will not reflect over that related page... for ex. if we have to use some color but you have its hex code, you are not going to remember it all time so you are going to comment it...

    ? /* this is css comment block */

    ! CSS Colors:
    -------------

    ? Hexadecimal declaration of colors:

    * range: 0-9 & a-f -> total 16 characters...
    * comes in a range of 3-characters and 6-characters...
    
    * red: f00 or ff0000
    * green: 0f0 or 00ff00
    * blue: 00f or 0000ff
    * white: fff or ffffff
    * black: 000 or 000000

    ? Named colors:

    * here you can simple provide the accurate color name...
    * color: red/blue/green/orange/cyan/purple/magenta/etc...

    ? RGB Colors:

    * using a method 'rgb(255,255,255)'
    * 0-255 is a range...
    * rgb(255,255,255)
    * rgb(255,0,0)
    * rgb(0,255,0)
    * rgb(0,0,255)
    * rgb(0,0,0)

    ? RGBA Colors:

    * same as RGB but addition of A(i.e. Alpha channel ranges from 0-1)
    * here alpha is used to set the color's opacity...
    * rgb(255,0,0,0.7)
    * rgb(0,255,0,0.5)
    * rgb(0,0,255,0.3)

    ? HSL (i.e.   HUE, SATURATION, LIGHTNESS)
    ? HSLA (i.e.   HUE, SATURATION, LIGHTNESS, ALPHA)

    ? some IMP things and understanding related to color...
    * Hue: A pure color. ex-> red(255,0,0) or green(0,255,0) or blue(0,0,255)
    
    * Tint: A pure color with just white added. for ex, in color selector in vscode(i.e when we have declared a color value and we are hovering on color then one box is pops-up) going from top-right to top-left is 'tint'...
    
    * Shade: a pure color with just black added(i.e. from top to bottom) or we can say from pure color to absolute black...
    
    * Tone: A pure color with just gray added (i.e. from pure color to diagonal left-side bottom)...
